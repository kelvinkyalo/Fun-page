            Marvel Comics is a publisher of American comic books and related media. 
            It counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as 
            Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther, 
            Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, Wolverine, Daredevil and Deadpool, and 
            such teams as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and 
            the Guardians of the Galaxy. Most of Marvel's fictional characters
            are depicted as occupying a shared fictional universe, most locations
            mirroring real-life places. Many major characters are based in New York City.
            Film adaptations based on Marvel Comics properties have included theatrically 
            released film serials, live action and animated feature films, direct-to-video
            releases, and television films.

        <h2>DC Universe	</h2>
        <div class="section-2">
         <p>
            The DC Universe (DCU) is the fictional shared universe where most stories in American
            comic book titles published by DC Comics take place. DC superheroes such as Superman,
            Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow,
            Booster Gold and Captain Atom are from this universe, and it also contains well-known 
            supervillains such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Brainiac, Professor Zoom, Mister Mind, 
            Black Adam, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Anti-Monitor and Darkseid. In context, the term
            "DC Universe" usually refers to the main DC continuity.
            The term "DC Multiverse" refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics 
            publications. Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, 
            but in recent years has been referred to by "Prime Earth" (not to be confused with 
            "Earth Prime")or "Earth 0".
            The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, began as the first
            shared universe in comic books and were quickly adapted to other media such as film serials
            or radio dramas.
            In subsequent decades, the continuity between all of these media became increasingly complex
            with certain storylines and events designed to simplify or streamline the more confusing 
            aspects of characters histories.
